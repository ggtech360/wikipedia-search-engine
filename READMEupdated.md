hello there, your task is to use debounce technique with the search input on the top of the page.

fork the repository and start working on it.

best of luck.

Added 1500ms delay so when a user enter anything it waits for 1500ms for user to complete his query then fetch the results. The time can be increased or decreased. Just change the value of delay and you are good to go.
